                Welcome to Planty !<br></br><br></br>
                
                The principle is simple: buy trees, always more trees !<br></br><br></br>
                
                When you created your account, you received three trees randomly. These trees bring you leaves (game currency) every 15 minutes. But beware, you will lose half of your leaves every hour. <br></br><br></br>
                
                Navigate through Liege with the map and buy new trees. By clicking on a tree, information appears. If the tree is free, you can buy it directly. The price is equal to the amount of leaves it will make you win every 15 minutes. If the tree already has an owner, you can still buy it but its price will vary from the number of trees you have in the area and those of other players. The more trees you have around, the lower the price. <br></br><br></br>

                To protect your trees, you have the possibility to lock them from your profile. The cost is high but it may be worth it. A locked tree can no longer be bought by another player.<br></br><br></br>
